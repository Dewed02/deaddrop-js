WARNING: MESSAGE HAS BEEN TAMPERED WITH FOR USER derek















I know this isn't ideal but here is the output the user will recieve if a message is tampered with:

/Users/derekwalton/logging/dist/db/message.js:47
        throw new Error("Integrity of the message cannot be verified.");
              ^

Error: Integrity of the message cannot be verified.
